## What are Authorities?

Authorities are entities authorized to issue attestations within the AttestProtocol system. They serve as the trust anchors that validate claims and create verifiable attestations about subjects.

In traditional systems, authorities include:
- Government agencies issuing IDs and licenses
- Universities granting degrees
- Financial institutions verifying creditworthiness
- Professional bodies certifying competencies

AttestProtocol brings this concept on-chain, enabling any entity to become a verifiable authority.

Personal wallets that issue attestations for specific purposes:

- Peer endorsements and recommendations
- Personal verifications and vouching
- Individual skill assessments
- Community member attestations

### Organizational Authorities

Registered entities providing professional attestation services:

- KYC/AML verification providers
- Educational institutions
- Professional certification bodies

## Becoming an Authority

### Registration Process

```typescript
// Register as authority
const result = await sdk.registerAuthority();

if (result.data) {
  console.log('Authority registered successfully');
  console.log('Authority address:', result.data.address);
}
```

### Authority Profile

Authorities can enhance their profile for better trust:

```typescript
// Update authority metadata (implementation varies by chain)
const profile = {
  name: "Acme Verification Services",
  website: "https://acme-verify.com",
  description: "Professional KYC and AML verification",
  categories: ["identity", "compliance"],
  jurisdiction: ["US", "EU", "UK"]
};
```

### Verification Levels

Authorities can achieve different trust levels:

| Level | Requirements | Benefits |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Basic** | Registered wallet address | Can issue attestations |
| **Verified** | Identity verification completed | Enhanced trust score |
| **Professional** | Business verification + insurance | Premium features access |
| **Institutional** | Regulatory compliance demonstrated | Highest trust rating |

---

## Authority Management

### Key Security

Protecting authority credentials is critical:

```typescript
// Best practice: Use hardware wallet or HSM
const signer = new HardwareWalletSigner({
  derivationPath: "m/44'/501'/0'/0'",
  device: 'ledger'
});

const sdk = await AttestSDK.initializeStellar({
  secretKeyOrCustomSigner: signer,
  publicKey: authorityPublicKey,
  url: RPC_URL
});
```

### Multi-Signature Setup

For high-security authorities:

```typescript
// Multi-sig authority setup
const multiSigAuthority = {
  signers: [
    { publicKey: 'signer1_pub', weight: 1 },
    { publicKey: 'signer2_pub', weight: 1 },
    { publicKey: 'signer3_pub', weight: 1 }
  ],
  threshold: 2 // Require 2 of 3 signatures
};
```

### Delegation

Authorities can delegate attestation capabilities:

```typescript
// Create delegated signer
const delegatedSigner = {
  address: 'delegate_address',
  permissions: ['kyc-basic', 'age-verification'],
  expiresAt: Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 30 days
};
```

---

## Trust and Reputation

### Trust Scoring

Authorities build reputation through their attestation history:

- **Attestation Volume**: Number of attestations issued
- **Revocation Rate**: Percentage of attestations revoked
- **Dispute Resolution**: How conflicts are handled
- **User Feedback**: Community ratings and reviews
- **Verification Level**: Authority verification status

### Reputation Metrics

```typescript
interface AuthorityReputation {
  totalAttestations: number;
  activeAttestations: number;
  revocationRate: number;
  disputeRate: number;
  averageRating: number;
  verificationLevel: 'basic' | 'verified' | 'professional' | 'institutional';
  specializations: string[];
}
```

### Building Trust

Strategies for authorities to build reputation:

1. **Start Small**: Begin with low-risk attestations
2. **Be Transparent**: Publish verification methodology
3. **Maintain Quality**: Low revocation and dispute rates
4. **Specialize**: Focus on specific attestation types
5. **Get Verified**: Complete higher verification levels

---

## Authority Operations

### Issuing Attestations

Standard attestation issuance flow:

```typescript
// 1. Verify subject identity/claims
const verificationResult = await verifySubject(subjectAddress, claimData);

// 2. Create attestation if verified
if (verificationResult.verified) {
  const attestation = await sdk.attest({
    schemaUID: 'kyc-basic-v1',
    subject: subjectAddress,
    value: 'verified:true,level:basic,score:85,timestamp:1704067200',
    reference: `verification-${Date.now()}`
  });
}

// 3. Store verification records
await storeVerificationRecord(attestation.data);
```

### Batch Operations

Issue multiple attestations efficiently:

```typescript
// Batch attestation issuance
const subjects = [
  { address: '0x123...', data: 'verified:true,score:90' },
  { address: '0x456...', data: 'verified:true,score:85' },
  { address: '0x789...', data: 'verified:true,score:92' }
];

const attestations = await Promise.all(
  subjects.map(subject => 
    sdk.attest({
      schemaUID: 'verification-v1',
      subject: subject.address,
      value: subject.data,
      reference: `batch-${Date.now()}`
    })
  )
);
```

### Revocation Management

Authorities can revoke attestations they issued:

```typescript
// Revoke attestation
const revocation = await sdk.revokeAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic-v1',
  subject: subjectAddress,
  reference: 'original-reference'
});

// Best practice: Log revocation reason
await logRevocation({
  attestationId: revocation.data.attestationUID,
  reason: 'Failed re-verification',
  timestamp: Date.now()
});
```

## Authority Models

### Centralized Authority

Single entity controls attestation issuance:

```
Authority → Attestation → Subject
```

**Use Cases**:
- Government ID verification
- Professional licensing
- Educational credentials

### Federated Authorities

Multiple authorities share attestation responsibilities:

```
Authority A ─┐
Authority B ─┼→ Combined Attestation → Subject
Authority C ─┘
```

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance
- Cross-institutional verification
- Consortium-based credentialing

### Hierarchical Authorities

Authorities delegate to sub-authorities:

```
Root Authority
    ├── Regional Authority A
    │   ├── Local Verifier 1
    │   └── Local Verifier 2
    └── Regional Authority B
        ├── Local Verifier 3
        └── Local Verifier 4
```

**Use Cases**:
- Global organizations
- Franchise operations
- Tiered verification systems

### Decentralized Authority Networks

Peer-to-peer authority relationships:

```
Authority A ↔ Authority B
    ↕           ↕
Authority D ↔ Authority C
```

**Use Cases**:
- Web of trust models
- Community verification
- Reputation networks

---

## Economic Models

### Fee Structures

Authorities can monetize their services:

```typescript
// Fee configuration
const authorityFees = {
  'kyc-basic': 10, // $10 USD equivalent
  'kyc-enhanced': 50, // $50 USD equivalent
  'professional-cert': 100, // $100 USD equivalent
};

// Check fee before attestation
async function processAttestation(schemaType: string, payment: number) {
  const requiredFee = authorityFees[schemaType];
  
  if (payment >= requiredFee) {
    // Process attestation
    return await issueAttestation(schemaType);
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Insufficient payment. Required: ${requiredFee}`);
  }
}
```

### Staking Models

Authorities stake tokens to ensure quality:

```typescript
// Authority staking requirement
const stakingRequirements = {
  basic: 1000, // 1,000 tokens
  verified: 10000, // 10,000 tokens
  professional: 50000, // 50,000 tokens
  institutional: 100000 // 100,000 tokens
};
```

### Revenue Sharing

Distribute fees across participants:

```typescript
// Revenue distribution
const feeDistribution = {
  authority: 0.70, // 70% to issuing authority
  protocol: 0.20, // 20% to protocol treasury
  referrer: 0.10 // 10% to referrer (if any)
};
```

---

## Compliance and Standards

### Regulatory Compliance

Authorities must consider:

- **Data Protection**: GDPR, CCPA compliance
- **KYC/AML Requirements**: Financial regulations
- **Industry Standards**: ISO, SOC certifications
- **Jurisdictional Rules**: Local law compliance

### Best Practices

```typescript
// Compliance checklist
const complianceChecks = {
  dataMinimization: true, // Only collect necessary data
  userConsent: true, // Explicit consent for attestations
  dataRetention: 365, // Days to retain records
  encryptionRequired: true, // Encrypt sensitive data
  auditTrail: true // Maintain verification logs
};
```

### Liability Management

- **Terms of Service**: Clear attestation terms
- **Insurance**: Professional liability coverage
- **Disclaimers**: Appropriate legal disclaimers
- **Dispute Process**: Clear resolution procedures

---

## Integration Examples

### KYC Provider Integration

```typescript
class KYCAuthority {
  private sdk: AttestSDKBase;
  
  async verifyAndAttest(userData: any) {
    // 1. Perform KYC checks
    const kycResult = await this.performKYCChecks(userData);
    
    // 2. Create attestation
    if (kycResult.passed) {
      const attestation = await this.sdk.attest({
        schemaUID: 'kyc-enhanced-v1',
        subject: userData.walletAddress,
        value: `verified:true,level:${kycResult.level},score:${kycResult.score},checkDate:${Date.now()}`,
        reference: kycResult.sessionId
      });
      
      // 3. Store compliance records
      await this.storeComplianceRecord({
        attestationId: attestation.data.attestationUID,
        kycData: kycResult,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      });
      
      return attestation;
    }
    
    throw new Error('KYC verification failed');
  }
}
```

### DAO Authority System

```typescript
class DAOAuthority {
  async issueMembershipAttestation(memberAddress: string, daoVote: any) {
    // Verify DAO vote passed
    if (daoVote.passed && daoVote.type === 'membership') {
      const attestation = await this.sdk.attest({
        schemaUID: 'dao-membership-v1',
        subject: memberAddress,
        value: `isMember:true,joinDate:${Date.now()},votingPower:${daoVote.votingPower}`,
        reference: `proposal-${daoVote.proposalId}`
      });
      
      return attestation;
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Authority Dashboard Metrics

Track key performance indicators:

```typescript
interface AuthorityMetrics {
  attestationsIssued: {
    total: number;
    daily: number;
    weekly: number;
    monthly: number;
  };
  revocationRate: number;
  averageProcessingTime: number;
  revenueGenerated: number;
  activeUsers: number;
  schemaUsage: Record<string, number>;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// Monitor attestation performance
async function trackAttestationMetrics(attestation: any) {
  await analytics.track({
    event: 'attestation_issued',
    properties: {
      schemaType: attestation.schemaUID,
      processingTime: attestation.processingTime,
      authorityId: attestation.authorityAddress,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }
  });
}
```
