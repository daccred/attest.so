## What is AttestProtocol?

AttestProtocol is a unified trust framework for blockchain-based attestations. We make on-chain verification as simple as checking a boolean - no complex smart contracts, no cryptographic headaches, just attestations that work.

Think of us as the **reputation layer for Web3**. Whether you're building a DeFi protocol, a DAO, or any dApp that needs trust, AttestProtocol provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for creating and verifying on-chain attestations.

## Why AttestProtocol?

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to verify a user's KYC status:

```javascript
import { AttestClient } from '@attestprotocol/sdk';

const client = new AttestClient({
  chain: 'solana',
  apiKey: process.env.ATTEST_API_KEY
});

// Verify a user's attestation
const isVerified = await client.verify({
  subject: userAddress,
  schema: 'kyc-basic'
});

if (isVerified) {
  // User is KYC verified - proceed with transaction
  console.log('User is verified âœ…');
}
```

That's it. No smart contract deployments, no complex queries, just simple verification.

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Attestations">
    Verifiable claims made by trusted authorities about subjects (users, contracts, etc.). Think of them as on-chain certificates that prove something about an entity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Schemas">
    Structured templates that define what data an attestation contains. Like database schemas, but for on-chain trust data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authorities">
    Trusted entities with permission to issue attestations. Could be KYC providers, DAOs, or any organization that can vouch for something.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subjects">
    The entities (wallet addresses, smart contracts) that attestations are made about. Your users, essentially.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

AttestProtocol powers trust for various Web3 applications:

- **DeFi Protocols**: KYC verification, credit scoring, reputation systems
- **DAOs**: Member verification, governance participation, role attestations  
- **Gaming**: Achievement systems, identity verification, anti-sybil protection
- **Social**: Identity verification, reputation scores, community memberships
- **Enterprise**: Compliance attestations, certification tracking, audit trails
