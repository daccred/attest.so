## Decentralized Attestation Infrastructure on Stellar

AttestProtocol is a modular, secure attestation infrastructure built on Stellar's Soroban smart contracts. It provides enterprise-grade capabilities for building verifiable credential systems through cryptographic delegation, payment-gated authority verification, and flexible resolver patterns.

The platform separates core attestation logic from business rules through a resolver pattern, enabling flexible economic models while maintaining security and immutability.

### Key Architecture Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security by Design">
    Immutable core protocol logic with cryptographic validation at every step. BLS signature verification, nonce-based replay protection, and atomic operations ensure data integrity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Resolver Pattern">
    Separate business logic from core attestation infrastructure. Custom resolvers enable payment validation, token rewards, and complex access control without modifying protocol contracts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Economic Security">
    Payment requirements (100 XLM verification fee) create economic barriers to Sybil attacks while platform due diligence ensures legitimate organizations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete Observability">
    Horizon indexer tracks ALL contract interactions - not just events - providing comprehensive visibility for optimal user experience.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how to work with the Stellar SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Initialize Client
import { StellarAttestationClient } from '@attestprotocol/stellar-sdk';

const client = new StellarAttestationClient({
  rpcUrl: 'https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org',
  network: 'testnet',
  publicKey: 'GBXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
});
```

```typescript Create Attestation
import { Keypair } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';

const signer = Keypair.fromSecret(process.env.STELLAR_SECRET);

await client.attest({
  schemaUid: Buffer.from('abc123...', 'hex'),
  value: JSON.stringify({ verified: true, level: 'enhanced' }),
  subject: 'GSUBJECT123...',
  options: { signer }
});
```

```typescript Delegated Attestation
const { privateKey, publicKey } = client.generateBlsKeys();

const request = await createDelegatedAttestationRequest({
  schemaUid: Buffer.from('abc...', 'hex'),
  subject: 'GSUBJECT...',
  data: JSON.stringify({ verified: true })
}, privateKey, client.getClientInstance());

await client.attestByDelegation(request, { signer: myKeypair });
```
</CodeGroup>

Cryptographic delegation enables secure off-chain signing with on-chain verification through BLS signatures.

## Core Architecture Components

AttestProtocol's Stellar implementation consists of interconnected smart contracts and infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Protocol Contract" icon="cube" href="/chains/stellar/protocol-contract">
    **Immutable Attestation Engine**

    Core Soroban contract managing schema registration, attestation lifecycle, BLS signature verification, and nonce-based replay protection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authority Contract" icon="building" href="/chains/stellar/authority-contract">
    **Payment-Gated Resolver**

    Reference implementation demonstrating payment validation (100 XLM), authority registry, and resolver integration with the protocol.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Resolver Pattern" icon="plug" href="/concepts/resolvers">
    **Business Logic Abstraction**

    Standardized interface for custom validation logic, side effects, and economic models without modifying core protocol contracts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Horizon Indexer" icon="server" href="/architecture/horizon-indexer">
    **Comprehensive Data Layer**

    Express.js indexer tracking ALL contract interactions - events, operations, transactions, and account states for complete visibility.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Data Flow Architecture

The complete authority verification workflow demonstrates the system integration:

1. **Payment Processing**: Organization pays 100 XLM verification fee to Authority contract
2. **Due Diligence**: Platform performs off-chain KYB/enterprise verification
3. **Delegated Signing**: Platform creates attestation request signed with BLS private key
4. **Protocol Validation**: Protocol contract verifies BLS signature and calls resolver
5. **Resolver Check**: Authority contract validates payment before approving attestation
6. **Storage & Registry**: Attestation stored on-chain, authority registered in phone book

This architecture separates economic models from core logic while maintaining cryptographic security.

## Production Use Cases

AttestProtocol's current implementation focuses on enterprise verification:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    **Payment-Gated KYB**
    - 100 XLM verification fee prevents spam
    - Platform performs enterprise due diligence
    - Cryptographic delegation for scalability
    - Public phone book registry of authorities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credential Issuance" icon="certificate">
    **Schema-Based Attestations**
    - Organizations issue verifiable credentials
    - Immutable on-chain storage
    - Optional expiration and revocation
    - Reference linking for claim provenance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Resolvers" icon="code-branch">
    **Flexible Business Logic**
    - Token reward distributions
    - Fee collection mechanisms
    - Access control policies
    - Side effect processing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Comprehensive Indexing" icon="database">
    **Full Contract Visibility**
