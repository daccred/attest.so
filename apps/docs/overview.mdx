## The trust layer for Web3. One line of code.

AttestProtocol is an open, schema-based attestation infrastructure that allows developers, businesses, and authorities to create verifiable credentials on-chain and off-chain without deploying smart contracts.

Whether it's KYC, GitHub contributions, or community roles, AttestProtocol is the new universal proof layer that transforms trust from implicit assumptions into explicit, verifiable, and portable digital assets.

### Key Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Composability">
    Attestations can be integrated across dApps and chains, enabling cross-platform trust verification without vendor lock-in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flexibility">
    Anyone can issue or verify attestations using shared schemas, democratizing access to trust infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interoperability">
    Structured data works seamlessly across the ecosystem with schema-enforced compatibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Simplicity">
    Schema-first approach reduces complexity to one line of code, accelerating development and adoption.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to issue and verify attestations:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Issue Attestation
import { AttestSDK } from '@attestprotocol/sdk';

const sdk = await AttestSDK.initializeStellar({
  secretKeyOrCustomSigner: process.env.STELLAR_SECRET_KEY,
  publicKey: process.env.STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY
});

// Issue a KYC attestation
const attestation = await sdk.attest({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic',
  subject: userAddress,
  value: 'verified:true,level:enhanced,score:95',
  reference: 'kyc-2024-001'
});
```

```javascript Verify Attestation
// Verify user's KYC status
const result = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic',
  subject: userAddress
});

if (result.data && !result.data.revoked) {
  console.log('User is KYC verified âœ…');
  // Proceed with restricted actions
}
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it. No smart contract deployments, no complex queries, just simple attestation workflows.

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Attestations">
    Verifiable claims made by trusted authorities about subjects (users, contracts, etc.). Think of them as on-chain certificates that prove something about an entity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Schemas">
    Structured templates that define what data an attestation contains. Like database schemas, but for on-chain trust data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authorities">
    Trusted entities with permission to issue attestations. Could be KYC providers, DAOs, or any organization that can vouch for something.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subjects">
    The entities (wallet addresses, smart contracts) that attestations are made about. Your users, essentially.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
