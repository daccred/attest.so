## The trust layer for Web3. One line of code.

AttestProtocol is an open, schema-based attestation infrastructure that allows developers, businesses, and authorities to create verifiable credentials on-chain and off-chain without deploying smart contracts.

Whether it's KYC, GitHub contributions, or community roles, AttestProtocol is the new universal proof layer that transforms trust from implicit assumptions into explicit, verifiable, and portable digital assets.

### Key Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Composability">
    Attestations can be integrated across dApps and chains, enabling cross-platform trust verification without vendor lock-in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Flexibility">
    Anyone can issue or verify attestations using shared schemas, democratizing access to trust infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interoperability">
    Structured data works seamlessly across the ecosystem with schema-enforced compatibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Simplicity">
    Schema-first approach reduces complexity to one line of code, accelerating development and adoption.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to issue and verify attestations:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Issue Attestation
import { AttestSDK } from '@attestprotocol/sdk';

const sdk = await AttestSDK.initializeStellar({
  secretKeyOrCustomSigner: process.env.STELLAR_SECRET_KEY,
  publicKey: process.env.STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY
});

// Issue a KYC attestation
const attestation = await sdk.attest({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic',
  subject: userAddress,
  value: 'verified:true,level:enhanced,score:95',
  reference: 'kyc-2024-001'
});
```

```javascript Verify Attestation
// Verify user's KYC status
const result = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic',
  subject: userAddress
});

if (result.data && !result.data.revoked) {
  console.log('User is KYC verified âœ…');
  // Proceed with restricted actions
}
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it. No smart contract deployments, no complex queries, just simple attestation workflows.

## Core Concepts

AttestProtocol is built on four fundamental concepts that work together to create a comprehensive trust infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attestations" icon="certificate" href="/concepts/attestations">
    **Cryptographically signed claims**
    
    Verifiable statements made by trusted authorities about subjects. These are the core trust primitives that prove facts about users, contracts, or any entity on-chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Schemas" icon="database" href="/concepts/schemas">
    **Structured data templates**
    
    Define the format, types, and validation rules for attestation data. Schemas ensure consistency and interoperability across all applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authorities" icon="shield-check" href="/concepts/authorities">
    **Trusted attestation issuers**
    
    Entities authorized to create attestations. Can be individuals, organizations, DAOs, or smart contracts with permission to make verifiable claims.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Verification" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/concepts/verification">
    **Trust validation system**
    
    The process of checking attestation authenticity, authority permissions, and data integrity to confirm claims are valid and trustworthy.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How They Work Together

The four concepts create a complete trust ecosystem:

1. **Authorities** register and gain permission to issue attestations
2. **Schemas** define what data structures attestations can contain
3. **Attestations** are created by authorities following schema specifications
4. **Verification** ensures attestations are authentic and authorities are trusted

This architecture enables any application to implement sophisticated trust verification without deploying custom smart contracts or managing complex cryptographic operations.
