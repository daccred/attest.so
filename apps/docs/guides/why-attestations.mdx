## What Are Attestations

Attestations are cryptographically signed claims that establish verifiable facts about users, actions, assets, or events. They serve as the digital infrastructure for trust in decentralized systems, replacing implicit assumptions with explicit, verifiable proofs.

---

## The Trust Problem in Web3

### Current Limitations

**"Trust Me Bro" Culture**: Many Web3 interactions rely on unverified claims and social consensus rather than cryptographic proof.

**Identity Silos**: User credentials and reputation remain locked within individual platforms, preventing portability and cross-application utility.

**Verification Overhead**: Applications must build custom verification logic, creating inconsistent trust models and development overhead.

**Limited Programmability**: Traditional credentials lack the structured data formats needed for automated verification and smart contract integration.

---

## Why Attestations Solve This

### Digital Trust Infrastructure
Attestations replace subjective trust with cryptographically verifiable facts, enabling applications to make trust-based decisions programmatically.

### Decentralized Identity
Users control their credentials as portable digital assets, eliminating dependency on centralized identity providers and reducing platform lock-in.

### On-Chain Utility
Structured attestation data integrates directly with smart contracts, enabling dynamic permissions, automated incentives, and real-time analytics.

### Interoperability Standards
Standardized schemas ensure attestations work consistently across applications, chains, and ecosystems without custom integration work.

## Attestation Benefits

### For Users

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Portable Identity** | Credentials follow users across platforms and applications |
| **Privacy Control** | Selective disclosure of verified attributes without exposing raw data |
| **Reduced Friction** | One-time verification enables access to multiple services |
| **Ownership** | Direct control over personal attestations and their usage |

### For Developers

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Simple Integration** | Add trust verification with single SDK calls |
| **Standardized Data** | Consistent formats across all attestations and schemas |
| **Reduced Liability** | Outsource verification to specialized authorities |
| **Cross-Platform** | Same attestations work across multiple applications |

### For Authorities

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Monetization** | Generate revenue from verification services |
| **Reputation Building** | Establish credibility through accurate attestations |
| **Specialization** | Focus on specific verification domains and expertise |
| **Scale Efficiency** | Issue attestations once for multiple consuming applications |

## Use Case Examples

### Identity and Compliance

**KYC Verification for DeFi Access**
```typescript
// Check if user has valid KYC attestation
const kycResult = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'kyc-basic-v1',
  subject: userAddress
});

if (kycResult.data && !kycResult.data.revoked) {
  // Enable DeFi features for verified users
  enableAdvancedTrading(userAddress);
}
```

**Age Verification for Restricted Content**
```typescript
// Verify user meets minimum age requirement
const ageResult = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'age-verification',
  subject: userAddress
});

const ageData = parseAttestationData(ageResult.data.value);
if (ageData.minimumAge >= 18) {
  grantContentAccess(userAddress);
}
```

### Governance and DAOs

**Voting Weight by Contribution**
```typescript
// Calculate voting power based on verified contributions
const contributions = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'dao-contribution-score',
  subject: memberAddress
});

const votingWeight = parseAttestationData(contributions.data.value).totalScore;
await castVote(proposalId, memberAddress, vote, votingWeight);
```

**Event Attendance Verification**
```typescript
// Verify attendance at governance events
const attendance = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'event-attendance',
  subject: userAddress
});

if (attendance.data) {
  const events = parseAttestationData(attendance.data.value).eventIds;
  if (events.includes('governance-summit-2024')) {
    grantSpecialVotingRights(userAddress);
  }
}
```

### Gaming and NFTs

**Cross-Game Reputation**
```typescript
// Port gaming achievements across platforms
const reputation = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'gaming-reputation',
  subject: playerAddress
});

const repData = parseAttestationData(reputation.data.value);
const playerLevel = repData.overallRating;

// Unlock content based on verified reputation
if (playerLevel >= 75) {
  unlockPremiumContent(playerAddress);
}
```

### Professional Credentials

**Skill Verification for DAO Participation**
```typescript
// Verify technical skills for development DAO
const skills = await sdk.fetchAttestation({
  schemaUID: 'developer-certification',
  subject: developerAddress
});

const skillData = parseAttestationData(skills.data.value);
if (skillData.languages.includes('Solidity') && skillData.experienceYears >= 2) {
  inviteToTechnicalDAO(developerAddress);
}
```

## Attestation Properties

### Cryptographic Security
Each attestation includes cryptographic signatures that prove the issuing authority created the claim, preventing forgery and ensuring data integrity.

### Selective Disclosure
Users can prove specific attributes without revealing underlying personal information, enabling privacy-preserving verification workflows.

### Time-Bound Validity
Attestations can include expiration dates and revocation mechanisms, ensuring claims remain current and accurate over time.

### Composable Data
Structured data formats enable complex verification logic, multi-criteria decision making, and automated trust scoring systems.

---

## Trust Model Evolution

### Traditional Web2 Model
- Centralized identity providers
- Platform-specific credentials  
- Limited portability
- Vendor lock-in effects

### Early Web3 Approaches
- Token-based identity systems
- NFT certificates
- Limited programmability
- High transaction costs

### AttestProtocol Model
- Decentralized attestation issuance
- Schema-standardized data formats
- Cross-platform portability
- Programmable trust infrastructure

---

## Implementation Benefits

### Reduced Development Time
Eliminate custom verification logic by consuming standardized attestations through simple SDK calls.

### Enhanced Security
Leverage cryptographic proofs instead of relying on self-reported user data or manual verification processes.

### Improved User Experience
Enable seamless onboarding and access control without requiring users to repeatedly verify the same credentials.

### Network Effects
Participate in a shared trust infrastructure where each attestation increases the overall utility and reliability of the system.

Attestations represent the evolution from implicit trust assumptions to explicit, verifiable, and programmable trust infrastructure that scales with the needs of decentralized applications and their users.
