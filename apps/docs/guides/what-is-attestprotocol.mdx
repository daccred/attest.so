## What is AttestProtocol?

AttestProtocol is an open, schema-based attestation infrastructure for Web3 that enables developers, businesses, and authorities to create verifiable credentials on-chain and off-chain without deploying smart contracts.

**The trust layer for Web3. One line of code.**

Whether it's KYC, GitHub contributions, or community roles, AttestProtocol is the new universal proof layer that transforms trust from implicit assumptions into explicit, verifiable, and portable digital assets.

<Info>
**AttestProtocol** is purpose-built for the next generation of applications that require trust without friction. Whether you're building for identity, credentials, assets, governance, or complianceâ€”attestations are the new primitive.

## Why Attestations Matter

Attestations are cryptographic claims about users, actions, or assets. They bring trust, portability, and programmatic verification into Web3.

### Real-World Examples

- **KYC verifications** for DeFi access and regulatory compliance
- **Event attendance proofs** for NFT drops and community rewards
- **Skill credentials** for DAO participation and role-based access
- **Asset ownership** for cross-platform gaming and digital collectibles

AttestProtocol provides the rails to make these proofs simple, scalable, and interoperable.

## What AttestProtocol Is

### Universal Proof Layer
AttestProtocol serves as the infrastructure layer for verifiable claims in Web3, supporting use cases from KYC verification to community participation proofs.

### Schema-Based System
Every attestation follows predefined schemas that establish data structure, validation rules, and interoperability standards across applications.

### Multi-Chain Protocol
Native support for Stellar/Soroban and Solana networks, with planned expansion to Starknet, Aptos, and Sui ecosystems.

### Developer Infrastructure
Production-ready SDKs, CLI tools, and APIs that integrate attestation capabilities into existing applications with minimal code changes.

---

## What AttestProtocol Is Not

### Not an Identity Provider
AttestProtocol doesn't manage user identities directly. Instead, it provides the infrastructure for any entity to make verifiable claims about users, assets, or events.

### Not Token-Based
Attestations are structured data with cryptographic signatures, not NFTs or tokens. They exist as verifiable claims that can be referenced and validated.

### Not Platform-Specific
Unlike single-chain solutions, AttestProtocol operates across multiple networks and can be integrated into any application architecture.

### Not Centrally Controlled
The protocol operates as decentralized infrastructure without central authority controlling attestation validity or access permissions.

## Key Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Schemas" icon="database" href="/concepts/schemas">
    **Reusable attestation templates**
    
    Define attestation structure, data types, and validation rules. Schemas ensure consistency and enable interoperability across applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authorities" icon="shield-check" href="/concepts/authorities">
    **Trusted attestation issuers**
    
    Entities authorized to issue attestations under specific schemas. Can be individuals, organizations, DAOs, or automated systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attestations" icon="certificate" href="/concepts/attestations">
    **Cryptographically signed claims**
    
    Verifiable claims that conform to schema specifications. Each attestation links an authority, subject, and structured data.

## Integration Approach

AttestProtocol integrates into existing applications through:

1. **Schema Selection**: Choose from existing schemas or create custom ones
2. **Authority Registration**: Establish credentials to issue attestations
3. **SDK Integration**: Add attestation calls to application logic
4. **Verification Implementation**: Query and validate attestations in real-time

The protocol serves as programmable infrastructure for trust, enabling applications to implement sophisticated verification workflows without blockchain development expertise.

AttestProtocol transforms trust from implicit assumptions into explicit, verifiable, and portable digital assets that enhance application security, user experience, and cross-platform interoperability.
