## 🌐 Overview

**attest.so** provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for builders to create "Reputation Authorities" on-chain with verifiable and comprehensive identity proofs. The project supports multiple blockchain platforms, enabling a unified approach to attestations and identity verification.

Our framework addresses critical challenges in Web3:

- **Identity Verification**: Robust mechanisms for verifying identities across blockchain ecosystems
- **Interoperable Trust**: Consistent attestation standards across multiple blockchains
- **Reputation Management**: Infrastructure for building and maintaining on-chain reputation
- **Scalable Solutions**: Enterprise-ready attestation infrastructure for builders

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Concepts

- **Attestations**: Verifiable, cryptographically signed claims made by an `Authority` about a `Subject`. They are structured according to a `Schema` and recorded on-chain.
- **Schemas**: Structured templates that define the format and data types for an attestation. They act as a blueprint, ensuring that attestations are consistent and machine-readable.
- **Authorities**: Trusted entities with the permission to issue, manage, and revoke attestations. Authorities are registered on-chain, and their integrity is verifiable.
- **Subjects**: The entities (e.g., users, smart contracts, organizations) about which attestations are made.
- **Resolvers**: On-chain programs responsible for interpreting and verifying attestations. They provide a standardized interface to locate, decode, and validate attestation data, and can be designed to handle complex logic such as dynamic schema resolution, revocation checks, and integration with off-chain data sources.

### Multi-Chain Support

attest.so is designed with cross-chain compatibility as a primary goal:

| Blockchain | Contract Language | Status      | Key Features                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stellar    | Soroban (Rust)    | Active      | Fee management, levy collection, verifiable authorities |
| Solana     | Anchor (Rust)     | Development | High throughput, scalable attestation storage           |
| Starknet   | Cairo             | Development | ZK-friendly proofs, privacy-preserving attestations     |
| Sui        | Move              | Planned     | Object-oriented attestation model                       |
| Aptos      | Move              | Planned     | Resource-oriented attestation model                     |

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. Smart Contracts

The repository contains modular smart contract implementations for multiple blockchain platforms:

#### Stellar/Soroban Implementation

Our Stellar implementation, built with Soroban, provides a robust framework for on-chain attestations. It leverages Rust for performance and safety, and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Stellar ecosystem, including Horizon and the Stellar SDK.

```
contracts/stellar/
├── authority/        # Manages and resolves authorities
├── protocol/         # Core attestation protocol logic
├── resolvers/        # Schema and attestation resolvers
└── ...               # Other configuration and build files
```

**Key Features:**

- **Authority Management**: Contracts for registering, verifying, and managing attestation authorities.
- **Core Protocol**: The central logic for creating, revoking, and managing attestations.
- **Resolvers**: Efficient on-chain logic to resolve schemas and attestations.
- **Soroban Integration**: Fully leverages Soroban's features for storage, authorization, and events.
- **Fee and Levy System**: Optional fee collection mechanism for monetizing attestation services.

#### Additional Blockchain Implementations

Implementation details for Solana (Anchor), Starknet (Cairo), and Aptos (Move) with blockchain-specific optimizations.

### 2. SDK (Software Development Kit)

A TypeScript SDK that provides a unified interface for interacting with our attestation infrastructure across different blockchains.

```typescript
// Example: Interacting with Stellar contracts via the SDK
import { AttestClient } from '@attestprotocol/sdk';
import { Keypair } from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';

// Initialize client for Stellar
const keypair = Keypair.fromSecret('YOUR_STELLAR_SECRET_KEY');
const client = new AttestClient({
  chain: 'stellar',
  network: 'testnet',
  secretKey: keypair.secret(),
});

// Create an attestation on Stellar
const attestation = await client.attest({
  schema: 'did:attest:identity',
  subject: 'G...', // Subject's Stellar public key
  claims: { verified: true, level: 'premium' },
});
```

**Core Functionality:**

- Blockchain connection management
- Schema creation and registration
- Attestation lifecycle management
- Cross-chain verification utilities
- TypeScript-first for a better developer experience

### 3. CLI (Command Line Interface)

A powerful command-line tool for developers and administrators to interact with the protocol directly from the terminal.

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @attestprotocol/cli

# Create a new attestation on the Stellar testnet
attest create \
  --schema did:attest:identity \
  --subject G... \
  --chain stellar \
  --network testnet \
  --claims '{"verified": true}'
```

## Setting up Rust Analyzer

With Rust Analyzer installed, you can configure it to recognize all our Rust-based contract projects. This is essential for a smooth development experience, providing features like auto-completion and type-checking.

Add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
    "contracts/stellar/Cargo.toml",
    "contracts/solana/Cargo.toml"
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures that Rust Analyzer can correctly interpret the dependencies and structure of each contract crate within our monorepo.
