/// Revokes an existing attestation and emits a `Revoked` event.
///
/// This function marks an attestation as revoked by setting its `revocation_time`.
/// It ensures that the attestation is revocable and has not already been revoked.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `ctx` - The context containing the accounts required for revoking the attestation.
/// * `schema_uid` - The UID of the schema associated with the attestation (used in PDA derivation).
/// * `recipient` - The public key of the recipient (used in PDA derivation).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// * `AttestationError::Irrevocable` - If the attestation is marked as irrevocable.
/// * `AttestationError::AlreadyRevoked` - If the attestation has already been revoked.
/// * `AttestationError::InvalidSchema` - If the attestation's schema does not match the provided schema UID.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// - **PDA Derivation**: Uses the `schema_uid`, `recipient`, and `attester` to derive the attestation PDA.
/// - **Revocability Check**: Ensures that the attestation is revocable.
/// - **Revocation Status Check**: Ensures that the attestation has not already been revoked.
/// - **Revocation Time Update**: Sets the `revocation_time` to the current timestamp.
/// - **Event Emission**: Emits a `Revoked` event for off-chain indexing.
///
/// # Why We Are Doing This
///
/// Revoking attestations allows attesters to invalidate claims they have previously made.
/// Emitting events facilitates off-chain indexing and enables clients to stay updated
/// with attestation statuses without polling the blockchain.
