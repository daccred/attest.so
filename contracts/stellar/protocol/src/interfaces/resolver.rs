/// Resolver Contract Client Interface
///
/// This interface defines the contract between the protocol and resolver implementations.
/// Resolvers provide custom business logic for attestation validation, economic models,
/// and post-processing hooks.
///
/// The ResolverClient is auto-generated from this trait and provides type-safe
/// cross-contract calls to resolver implementations. Each method corresponds to
/// a specific hook in the attestation lifecycle:
///
/// - onattest: Validates whether an attestation should be allowed (pre-creation)
/// - onrevoke: Validates whether a revocation should be allowed (pre-revocation)  
/// - onresolve: Handles post-processing after attestation/revocation (side effects)
///
/// Security Model:
/// - onattest/onrevoke return boolean values that gate protocol actions
/// - onresolve failures are logged but don't revert transactions
/// - Resolvers implement access control, economic barriers, and business logic
///
